## About Me:

I am an undergraduate student in my first year at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering. I have been interested in programming all through my schooling years and am now working on realising the job opportunities the programming career has for me. In this light I have been working on learning more and more programming languages and also contributing to Open Source. I have 3 Open Source projects currently, one of which is still being actively contributed to by me. I am majorly from a python background and have explored a number of libraries such as pandas, numpy, kivy, scikit-learn, discord.py, pillow, and matplotlib. I am majorly interested in Game Development and am also working on projects towards the same. I am also a part of a number of clubs in my institute and believe in balancing the virtual as well as real world activities through mindful use of technology.

## Understanding of The Project

Currently the project is in the first stage, which means it has to be built up from scratch currently. Therefore most of the content that is to be utilised for reference is the README.md which shows in breief the features expected from the app. 

## Deliverables

Currently my interest lies mainly in the documentation and feature elaboration. I can also work with minor contribution in the front end through Flutter, on which I have enough knowledge to work, and using which I have tried to make some amount of apps.

1. Work on the proper README.md documentation and feature elaboration.
    1. ReadTheDocs can also be utilised for further documentation of the various user-defined nuances used for the app, or for any other API the app can support.
    2. In-Code documentation can also be inserted via code comments that can be done as newer pull requests get added to the repository.
2. Implementation of Basic App layouts of the app inspired by the layout of Google Classroom.
    1. I can try to implement the features of Time Table and Lost and Found, and the basic front-end of Classroom Vacancy.
    2. Another idea I can add to the already expansive list of ideas would be the implementation of permanent clubrooms that work as the chatrooms for clubs. The difference with these chatrooms would be that they would be permanent and the members will keep having different level of authority as authorised by the main admin of the said chatroom. Entry to these will only be controlled via an "Entry Password".

## Ending Notes

This is my first open source event and thus I am pretty excited to begin contributing amongst a plethora of people with a wide variety of experience in both software development and open source contributions. I hope that my contribution in this project will be fruitful and that I can see the project's first iteration be brought to a successful start. I will definitely keep contributing to not only this project but to other projects on OpenLake whenever possible.
